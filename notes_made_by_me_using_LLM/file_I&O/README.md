# File Input/Output (File I/O)

## Overview
Comprehensive notes on Python file I/O operations, including reading, writing, and manipulating files with various techniques and best practices.

## What I Learned
- **File Opening Modes**: Understanding different file modes (r, w, a, x, b, +) and their use cases
- **Reading Files**: Various methods like `read()`, `readline()`, `readlines()` for different file reading scenarios
- **Writing Files**: Methods for writing data including `write()`, `writelines()`, and handling overwriting vs appending
- **File Context Managers**: Using `with` statements for automatic file handling and resource cleanup
- **Chat GPT Integration**: Explored file operations in context of LLM APIs and prompt management
- **Gemini API**: Working with file I/O for API interactions and response handling
- **Input/Output Complexity**: Understanding buffering, encoding, and performance considerations

## Main Concepts
- File objects and their lifecycle
- Text vs binary mode operations
- CSV and JSON file handling
- Stream processing and large file handling
- Error handling in file operations
- Encoding and character sets
