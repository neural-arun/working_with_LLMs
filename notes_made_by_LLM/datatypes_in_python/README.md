# Datatypes in Python

## Overview
Comprehensive notes on Python datatypes including dictionaries and lists, covering all essential methods and operations.

## What I Learned
- **Dictionary Methods**: Explored dict operations like `get()`, `keys()`, `values()`, `items()`, `update()`, `pop()`, and more
- **List Methods**: Learned list manipulation techniques including `append()`, `extend()`, `insert()`, `remove()`, `pop()`, `sort()`, and `reverse()`
- **Built-in Functions**: Understood how to work with collection datatypes effectively using Python's built-in methods

## Main Concepts
- Mutable vs Immutable data structures
- Key-value pairs in dictionaries
- Ordered sequence operations in lists
- Common methods and their use cases

## Files
- `dict_methods.md` - Detailed dictionary methods documentation
- `list_methods.md` - Detailed list methods documentation
