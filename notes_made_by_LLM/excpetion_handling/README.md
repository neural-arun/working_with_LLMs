# Exception Handling

## Overview
Detailed notes on Python exception handling mechanisms, including try-except blocks, custom exceptions, and error management best practices.

## What I Learned
- **Try-Except Blocks**: Understanding how to catch and handle exceptions gracefully
- **Exception Types**: Learned about common built-in exceptions (ValueError, TypeError, IndexError, KeyError, etc.)
- **Finally Block**: Using finally to execute cleanup code regardless of exceptions
- **Else Block**: Running code only if no exception occurred
- **Custom Exceptions**: Creating and raising custom exception classes
- **Error Handling Strategy**: Best practices for robust error handling in production code

## Main Concepts
- Exception hierarchy in Python
- Control flow with try-except-finally
- Raising and catching specific exceptions
- Error propagation
- Context managers and resource management
