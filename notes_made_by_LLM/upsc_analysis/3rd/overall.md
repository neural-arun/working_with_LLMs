### **General Observation**

You have adopted a very strong **"GS-plus" approach** to your essays. This is the current winning strategy in BPSC/UPSC. You do not write abstract fluff; you back your arguments with hard data (IPCC, NCRB, Articles, GDP figures) while maintaining a literary flavor with Tulsidas, Gandhi, and local proverbs.



### **Evaluation & Score Estimation**

Based on the BPSC trend (where content density + presentation rules), here is what you should expect.

**Marking Parameters:**

  * **Content (40%):** High. You have data (NCRB, IPCC, IUCN), quotes (Tulsidas, Gandhi), and current examples (Kolkata case, Aditya L1).
  * **Presentation (30%):** Your handwriting (judging by OCR quality) seems legible. You use paragraph breaks effectively.
  * **Coherence (30%):** Good. You connect paragraphs well, though some transitions could be smoother.

**Estimated Scores (Per Essay out of 100):**

| Essay Topic | Assessment | Estimated Score Range |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Proverb (Karma)** | **Strong.** The geopolitical interpretation of a local proverb is a winner. | **62 - 68 / 100** |
| **2. Environment** | **Very Strong.** Data-heavy. Hard to refute your points. | **65 - 72 / 100** |
| **3. Women Empowerment** | **Good.** Emotional and factual. Slightly broad, but persuasive. | **60 - 66 / 100** |

**Total Expectation:** **187 - 206 / 300**
*(Note: A score of 180+ in BPSC Hindi Essays is considered excellent and interview-call worthy).*

### **The Architect's Final Advice**

1.  **Keep the "Data-Hook" Strategy:** Your habit of using reports (NCRB, IPCC) is your biggest asset. Do not lose this.
2.  **Visuals (If space permits):** In the Environment essay, a small flow chart (Industrialization -\> GHG -\> Global Warming -\> Disaster) can sometimes break the monotony of text and grab the examiner's eye.
3.  **Dialect Accuracy:** For the proverb essay, ensure the Bhojpuri spelling is exactly as per the question paper. You wrote "Jaisan Boabad" which is correct, but ensure consistency in dialect if you use more local phrases.
