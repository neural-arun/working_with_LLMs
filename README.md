# Working with LLMs - Zero To Mastery Prompt Engineering Bootcamp

Welcome to my journey through the **Zero To Mastery Prompt Engineering Bootcamp**! This repository serves as a comprehensive documentation hub for my learning experience, hands-on projects, and experiments with Large Language Models.

## 🚀 What is the Zero To Mastery Prompt Engineering Bootcamp?

The Zero To Mastery Prompt Engineering Bootcamp is a comprehensive course designed to master the art and science of communicating effectively with Large Language Models (LLMs). This bootcamp covers everything from fundamental prompt engineering techniques to advanced strategies for building AI-powered applications.

The course focuses on practical, hands-on learning with real-world projects that demonstrate how to leverage LLMs for various applications including game development, career coaching, and interactive applications.

## 📚 My Learning Journey & Documentation Plan

This repository will serve as my digital learning lab where I:

- **Document Key Concepts**: Capture important prompt engineering principles, techniques, and best practices
- **Track Progress**: Maintain a learning log with reflections on each module and breakthrough moments
- **Share Code & Projects**: Upload all completed projects with detailed explanations and lessons learned
- **Experiment & Iterate**: Test different prompting strategies and document the results
- **Create Reference Materials**: Build a personal knowledge base for future prompt engineering work

Each project and concept will be thoroughly documented with:
- Implementation details and code
- Prompt engineering strategies used
- Challenges faced and solutions found
- Performance observations and optimizations
- Learnings and insights gained

## 🎯 Course Overview & Major Topics

### Core Curriculum Topics:
- **Fundamentals of Prompt Engineering**: Understanding LLM behavior, prompt structure, and optimization techniques
- **Advanced Prompting Strategies**: Chain-of-thought, few-shot learning, and context management
- **AI-Powered Game Development**: Building interactive games using LLM capabilities
- **Career & Professional Applications**: Creating AI assistants for career guidance and professional development
- **Real-World Implementation**: Deploying and scaling LLM-powered applications

### 🎮 Major Projects I'll Complete:
