    3.  Suggest three related follow-up questions for me to think about:
        -   One factual question for Prelims.

    4.  After I answer all questions, provide a detailed explanation for each one, explaining not just why the correct option is right, but also why the incorrect options are wrong. *Galtiyon se hi seekhna hai.*
